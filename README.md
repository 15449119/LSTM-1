LSTM
====

LSTM Neural Network in Python and Cython, used for language modelling

Based on LSTM RNN, model proposed by JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber
http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/
Inspired by RNN LM toolkit by Tomas Mikolov
http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/~imikolov/rnnlm/

Implemented by Daniel Soutner,
Department of Cybernetics, University of West Bohemia, Plzen, Czech rep.

CAHNGE LOG:

0.5.0
- algorithm validation
- input args improvement

0.4.4
- revision of algorithm

0.4.1
- speed up (about 4x - not bad) due not multiplying zeros in input vector
- nbest recsore make more secure (flush file); ability of splitting nbest file

0.4.0
- saving and loading in new format (cPickle version and different attributes)
- first experiments made and published with this version :)

0.3.6
- numerical stability provided (underflow in some places in computation)
- computation of PPL corrected (!!)

0.3.5
- added nbest rescoring function

0.3.4
- saving and loading of RNN

0.3.3
- output reduced to classes

0.3.2
- Softmax changed (should be faster)
- trying to handle numerical stability

0.2
- rewritten to Cython
- first really working release
- support of more input types of vector

0.1
- early not fully working build
- in Python, rewritten from Java

TODO (just ideas - probably will not be implemented :) ):
	- make training faster
	{C like arrays ?}
	{}
	- compile to one file
	- clean the code
	- open text with codecs.utf-8
	- rescoring/ppl: more than one srilm model, more than one LSTM net
	- better handle IO errors and exceptions
