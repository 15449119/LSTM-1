LSTM
====

LSTM Neural Network in Python and Cython, used for language modelling

Based on LSTM RNN, model proposed by JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber
http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/
Inspired by RNN LM toolkit by Tomas Mikolov

	http://wiki.cython.org/InstallingOnWindows
	gcc compile with -Ofast or -O3)

Python libs:
- numpy
- argparse (is in python 2.7 and higher)

Files:
- LSTM.pyx
- ArpaLM.py
- setup.py
- lstm.py

run
python setup.py build_ext --inplace --force

USAGE:

train LSTM LM on text and save

python lstm.py --train train.txt test.txt valid.txt --hidden 100 --save-net example.lstm-lm

sentences are processed independently (net is reset after every sentence), vocabulary limited to example.vocab (word-per-line)

python lstm.py --train train.txt test.txt valid.txt --hidden 100 --save-net example.lstm-lm --independent --vocabulary example.vocab

load net and evaluate on perplexity

python lstm.py --load-net example.lstm-lm --ppl valid2.txt

load net, combine with ARPA LM and evaluate

python lstm.py --load-net example.lstm-lm --ppl valid2.txt --srilm-file ngram.model.arpa --lambda 0.2

load net and rescore nbest list

python lstm.py --load-net example.lstm-lm --nbest-rescore nbest.list --wip 0 --lmw 11
